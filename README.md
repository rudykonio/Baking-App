# Baking-App
App queries a given Json file which includes a list of recipes  
(ingredients,making instructions,VideoURL...) and fetches all the data from it.  
When a recipe image is clicked the RecipeActivity will be launched(screenshot 1).  
The user will be able to navigate himself through the list of steps and click on the ingredients image as well, 
which will open the IngredientsActivity and will show the ingredients needed to make this dish 
(by entering the IngredientsActivity the widget will be updated as well if a widget instance was created).  
Clicking on a specific step will show its instructions and a video if there is one,or a default image if there isn't(screenshot 2) .  
App supports a Tablet version as well(screenshot 3) and includes Espresso basic UI tests.
